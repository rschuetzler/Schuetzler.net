<p>The Problem: An object has the right behavior, but the wrong interface</p>
<p>The Solution: The Adapter Pattern</p>
<p>This pattern is very similar to the Facade, but specifically adapted for one class. A wrapper is written for the class that has the wrong interface, with the wrapper providing the translation from the correct interface to the actual class being adapted. Fairly simple.</p>
