title: About me
---

<p>My name is Ryan, and I'm an aspiring nerd. I'm kind of a late bloomer in the tech world, because I pretty much didn't get started with anything techie until my junior year of college when I decided to be an Information Systems major at Brigham Young University. Now I'm a doctoral student in IS at the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>My interests include scuba diving, playing with my son, hanging out with my hot wife, and learning to do new things. In the last year I've picked up some Python, PHP, Drupal, Git, and rebuilt this site with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">Jekyll</a>. I'm sure there are other things, too, but I can't think of them right now.</p>
