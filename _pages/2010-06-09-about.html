So, you want to know a little about me. Well, here goes.

I'm a student in the MIS doctoral program at the University of Arizona. I recently graduated with my Master's of Information Systems Management from Brigham Young University. I have a beautiful wife and a super cool son who keep me on my toes.

This blog is as much a place for me as for anything else. This way I can keep track of how I did things, so I can have one place to look instead of having to go back to the great almighty Google for all my answers.
