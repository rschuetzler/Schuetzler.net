		    Okay, it's been a busy semester, so it's been a long time since I've posted anything here. I'd just like to give some updates:

1) I had a baby. He was born October 2, 2009 at 7:41 PM. He is awesome, and very well-behaved. He's not even a month old (well, he will be tomorrow) and he already sleeps 6-hour stretches at night. Amazing.

2) Windows 7 is out now. Of course, you already knew that, but what the hey.<!--more--> I have it installed on my home theater PC and I'm a huge fan. I played around with the beta and RC versions, and I've been doing that since the beta came out, but nothing beats the real thing. Honestly, that and Office for Mac are enough to convince me that I want my next computer to be a PC. I'm sure it's all part of Redmond's grand plan, but Office for Mac is an absolutely terrible product. Unfortunately, as a student I'm dependent on office software, and I wasn't brave enough to make the leap to iWork. Now I'm kinda regretting that decision, but I can't afford two office suites, so I fight with Office and excitedly wait for the day when I can switch to a Windows 7 machine full-time.

3) The Motorola Droid comes out this week, and I am super pumped for that. I've been a Verizon customer for the past 3 years and I don't really want to switch. They've been solid and reliable, and I used to work for AT&amp;T so I know about all the crap that they have to deal with. Unfortunately, until now, Verizon has not at any decent (i.e., cool) smartphone. Sure, there's the Blackberry Storm, but I'm too young to own a Blackberry. Now there's the Storm 2, which seems cooler, but still, it's a Blackberry.

The Droid, however, sounds awesome. I think the term iPhone killer is more than a little ridiculous because nothing is going to kill the iPhone, but I think it is a viable iPhone competitor. Android is a good operating system that is gaining momentum because it is available on phones for multiple carriers. There aren't as many apps for Android as there are for the iPhone, but how many apps do you really need? Considering that most apps are a <a href="http://www.crn.com/mobile/214502072;jsessionid=YRY4TTORZY3ZLQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN">download-and-forget</a> plaything, I'm not sure how much better 100,000 apps are than 12,000.

Now, I have to give my disclaimers here. I have never owned an iPhone. I have also never touched an Android phone. I probably won't own the Droid for at least a month (I'm working on convincing my wife that I <em>need </em>one :). But it is the first Verizon phone that I can say I am really excited about. When (and if) I ever get to upgrade to a cool phone, I'm thinking the Droid will be it. Open development, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/announcing-google-maps-navigation-for.html">turn-by-turn navigation</a>, and DVD-quality video are enough to make me want it. Plus, I don't have to go to AT&amp;T and deal with all their problems.

4) Did I mention I'm a dad? How cool is that?
