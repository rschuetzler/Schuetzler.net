		    I was searching and searching this morning for how to filter my Netflix recommendations based on the MPAA rating. A lot of movies I like are action movies, and it turns out a lot of action movies are rated R. Since I don't watch rated R movies, I spent a lot of time clicking through recommendations for movies I would never watch.<!--more-->

Apparently my problem was that I was looking in the wrong place. I thought the rating filtering would be under Taste Preferences. Turns out it's in another spot entirely. Here are the instructions that I found on the Netflix <a href="http://community.netflix.com/forum/topics/1993323:Topic:278?page=9&amp;commentId=1993323:Comment:7614&amp;x=1">Feature Wishlist</a>:
<ol>
	<li>Go to the top of the netflix website, next to your name, you'll see this link "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.netflix.com/YourAccount">Your Account</a>",</li>
	<li>After clicking on that, click on the link that says "Account Profiles",</li>
	<li>Click on "Edit" next to the profile you wish to change,</li>
	<li>Click on "Maturity Level" and choose the level you wish to have access to only.</li>
</ol>
If you don't want to see movies rated R, just set the maturity level to PG-13. It worked like a charm. I no longer see recommendations for rated R movies. I only wish this had been easier to find.

Update: After using this for a few months, I've noticed that it's less than perfect. The levels you can select are all movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R, All Movies). Unfortunately, TV show ratings are slightly different, and the filtering doesn't match up. For example, I selected PG-13 as my maturity level, but I want to be able to watch TV shows like 24, which is rated TV-14. Apparently because 14 is higher than 13, I can't watch TV-14 shows unless my filter settings are set to "R."
