<p>This is easy. I sometimes find myself just clicking around, bored, looking, reading, and generally wasting my time on the Internet. Here is a list of some of my favorite places to go to do it:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> - News for nerds. It's really easy</li>
	<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker.com</a> - Tips for just about everything.</li>
	<li><a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> "Explore" - finds feeds related to the things you read. This is a <em>huge</em> time waster, because it never ends. The recommendations get less relevant, but Google can always find something to read.</li>
	<li><a href="http://slickdeals.net">slickdeals.net</a> - A huge collection of good deals on anything. I mostly look for electronics deals, then wish I had money to take advantage of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another few ideas that I haven't done for a while:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> - a social bookmarking application. You bookmark sites you like, tell them what categories you are interested in, and StumbleUpon will provide you with an endless list of websites.</li>
	<li><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> (I still use it, but I don't check it nearly as often as I used to)</li>
</ul>
<p>What other sites have you used to pass those bored moments at school/work/home/anywhere?</p>
