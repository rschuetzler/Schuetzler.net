<p>It's been a while since I've posted anything to the blog, so I figured it's about time. Lately I've been working on getting IRB approval for my latest research project: training people on countermeasures to beat our lab's lie detector. We've been working on a multi-sensor device to detect deception in people during a quick interview using non-contact techniques. We use vocalics, eye movement, pupillometry, blinks, linguistics, and rigidity analyses to do the analysis. Before this beast goes out into production, we need to find out what it can do when people are trying to beat it, and that's my job.</p>
<p>I've also been continuing work on the paper I started at BYU. Its focus is on the benefits of distrust in small groups when they are working on certain types of tasks. This paper has been in and out of review for a while, and I'm getting pretty anxious to get it published. If this process has taught me anything, it's that research should be done on something you love, because you're going to be spending a very long time with it. I can't begin to count the number of times I've read, reread, edited, and reread this paper, and we're about to start another round. Always a good time.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm trying to figure out a way to use this blog more effectively. I find that I just don't update it enough, so I'm thinking I'm going to start posting the things I learn during class as a sort of combined class notes/learning blog. That way anyone else who is looking to learn the same stuff I learn can maybe benefit from my descriptions of stuff. So just a warning for you two readers out there, I may be stepping up the volume of posts here. I guess we'll see if I stick with it.</p>
