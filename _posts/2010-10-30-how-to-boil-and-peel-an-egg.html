<<p>I love hard boiled eggs. Unfortunately, I don't love peeling them because I usually end up with as much egg attached to the shell as not. I've scoured the globe looking for ways to avoid this frustration, and today, for the first time, I have cooked and peeled hard boiled eggs without wanting to break something. Here is my secret:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For 12 eggs, put them all in a big pot with cold water to cover them about 2 inches</li>
	<li>Add about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to water</li>
	<li>Place on burner on high</li>
	<li>When the water begins to boil, set a timer for 3 minutes</li>
	<li>After 3 minutes, remove from heat and cover. Leave for 8 minutes</li>
	<li>After 8 minutes, run cool water over the eggs for a little bit, then soak them in ice water for about 30-45 minutes</li>
	<li>Place eggs in refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours</li>
	<li>When ready to peel, tap an egg on the counter (all the way around) to break up the shell</li>
	<li>Lightly roll the egg on the counter to break the shell even more. If you roll to hard, the shell might start to come off, bringing some egg white with it</li>
	<li>Peel egg under running water, starting at the fat end.</li>
	<li>Take your time, but it should go fairly quickly, and be pretty easy to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, this is a compilation of a bunch of different tips I've found. I don't know if it's possible to remove some of them and still have an easy time. I just know that for the first time in a long time I didn't want to kill something after peeling a dozen hard boiled eggs.</p>
