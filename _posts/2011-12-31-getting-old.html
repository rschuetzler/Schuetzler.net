<p>I guess I'm getting older, and trying to prove that I'm not is getting harder and harder every time. I'm not that old, but some things have definitely gotten more difficult for me in the last few years. I think having a kid really does a lot to age a man. The most recent realization is that I'm now pretty much completely incapable of sleeping in. I never was very good at it. Even in high school on Saturdays I would wake up at 7 or 7:30 ready to go. Nine o'clock was pretty much unheard of for me to sleep in.</p>

<p>Now, though, I can't sleep in even if I really really need it. I try to prove that I'm not really so old.
