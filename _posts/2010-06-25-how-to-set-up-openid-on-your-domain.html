<p>I admit, I mostly stole this post from <a href="http://smarterware.org/6286/how-to-set-up-openid-on-your-own-domain">here</a>, but I feel it is valuable enough that I need to repost it.</p>

<p>Adding OpenID to your domain is seriously a piece of cake. For example, I own www.schuetzler.net (this site). By adding the following lines to the &lt;head&gt; of your homepage, you can use Google's OpenID, connected to your Google Account, to login to any website that allows OpenID. [Note: the second href= is your Google Profile URL. If you haven't set up a Google Profile, you can do so <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles">here</a>.</p>

<p><pre style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px; overflow-x: auto;">&lt;link rel="openid2.provider" href="https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud?source=profiles" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="openid2.local_id" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/101917908304099087510" /&gt;</pre></p>

<p>That's seriously all you need to do. Once that's set up, you can log into any site that accepts OpenID (including this one) by entering your domain for the OpenID.</p>
