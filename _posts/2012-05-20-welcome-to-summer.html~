<p>So, it's that time of year. As a grad student, my summers aren't terribly 
different from my school years. I don't have class, but in its place I have a 
whole host of papers, projects, and milestones to work on. This summer I have
to write up my preliminary exam (aka "prelim") so I can take that next step 
toward graduation. In the Fall I will have the written prelim, wherein I 
present on my paper that is at or around journal quality. I'm looking forward
to getting some data to analyze soon, and then the paper will start to write 
itself (ya right).</p>
