<p>I realized during the first week of classes this week that I will be programming more this semester than I ever have in my life. For some reason I have decided to punish myself by choosing 4 classes that each require me to program in a different language. Here's a breakdown of the classes and the programming projects required for them:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Computational Linguistics: This is one of the courses for my minor in Cognitive Science. For this one, I'll be working on various programming projects in Perl (and learning Perl in the process).</li>
    <li>Computer Vision: Another minor class. This one will be a bunch of projects in Matlab, which I have also never used.</li>
    <li>Quantitative Research: This one is a research-related class. It also turns out I have to learn linear algebra for this one. Fortunately, if the book for the class doesn't teach me everything I need, I've always got the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org#linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a> to help me out. The final project for this is to write a program to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofspiel">Goofspiel</a>. The grade for the final will depend on how well your program performs in a round-robin tournament with the other students' programs. Anyway, this one has to be in C++, the third and hopefully final new programming language for me this semester.</li>
    <li>Software Design and Integration: This is another class that I'm required to take for the program. It's primarily about design patterns, so hopefully it will make me a more awesome programmer. It also requires me to work with a group to write a program using the patterns we learn in class. The language for this is not specified, but I imagine it will probably be either Java or Python. I'll just have to wait and see what my as yet undetermined group members select.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm definitely looking forward to this semester. Some may wonder why I'm doing so much program in my IS Ph.D. program, but I really like it. I enjoy programming, and it is something that I really want to be better at. I will definitely be pushed, probably be stressed, but I will certainly be more awesome at the end of this semester than I was at the beginning.</p>
