description: New Year's resolutions for 2012
---
<p>It's that time again: New Year's Resolutions. I'm going to keep my list short and sweet this year. And hopefully simple and basic enough that I can actually do it. So here are my resolutions for the new year.</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Become less of a consumer of information</li>
	<li>Become a creator of information, or of something at least</li>
	<li>Write one of the programs floating around in my head</li>
	<li>Write down one new research topic every week day</li>
	<li>4x weekly of 30+ minutes exercise (kinda already started this one)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There may be more to come, but this is the starter list. One of my biggest goals in number one there. I read a lot. And I mean a whole lot. Blogs, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>, and things of the sort. That needs to get under control, and I need to start actually writing things, or doing something rather than just sitting around reading. I need a project that I can be passionate about and <strong>want</strong> to work on in my spare time. Some of those come and go, but none have stuck.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's how I hope to start the new year. Any other ideas for New Year's Resolutions besides the usual?</p>
