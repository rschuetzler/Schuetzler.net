<p>If you are a regular visitor to this blog, you may have noticed that it's changed quite a bit. For some reason, my Wordpress installation decided to go ape on me, and I wasn't able to update anything. I tried wiping the whole thing out and starting again, but to no avail. I've been looking for ways to increase my nerd status anyway, and I read a very interesting post on using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">Jekyll</a> as a blog semi-CMS. Since I use <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a> as my website host, moving to Jekyll saves me about a dollar/month in hosting costs. I think this way I may be able to host my entire site for less than $1/month.</p>



<p>I found a really great tutorial that got me most of the way there at <a href="http://hayley.ws/2010/12/04/getting-jekyll-running.html">hayley.ws</a>. Rather than installing jekyll myself, I had to email NSFN support and have them do it. The only other problem I had was with the post-receive script. The rm -Rf command did not work, as NFSN returned an error that the directory was not empty. Apparently even with the -Rf, it won't remove non-empty directories. So I modified the script to manually delete contents from each subdirectory, then remove the directory.</p>
