<p>Part of a project for my web mining class at UA is to create a website using 5 different APIs to accomplish some sort of useful task. A group of us have created a site to queue up movies you want to see, and be able to see those movies on Netflix, get reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, and purchase the movie from Amazon. It's called <a title="mis510proj" href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">MyFlixList</a>. Functionality is coming along nicely, so feel free to check it out here: <a title="mis510proj" href="http://www.videorentalexperts.com">mis510proj</a>.</p>
