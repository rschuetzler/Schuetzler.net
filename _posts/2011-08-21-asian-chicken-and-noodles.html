<p>In our family, we have a tradition of me cooking Sunday dinner. Sometimes it's pretty basic, like some grilled cheese or spaghetti with canned sauce. Other times I go all out and pull out a recipe. I'll start posting some of the more delicious recipe's here on the blog for all to see and enjoy. This week was <a href="http://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/2009/11/day-288-asian-chicken-and-noodles.html">Asian Chicken and Noodles</a> from the <a href="http://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/">365 days of CrockPot</a> <a href="http://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/2010/01/order-your-cookbook-now.html">cookbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Asian Chicken and Noodles</h2>

<p>Cut about 1 lb chicken breast or chicken thighs into bite size pieces.</p>

<p>Combine the following ingredients in medium size bowl and wisk until smooth:<br />
1/3 c creamy peanut butter<br />
1/4 c soy sauce<br />
1 T rice vinegar<br />
1 T lime juice<br />
1 1/2 tsp oil<br />
1 tsp hot chili sauce with garlic (I use Srirachi sauce)<br />
1/2 tsp ground ginger<br />
1/4 tsp salt<br />
2 garlic cloves minced</p>

<p>Toss chicken into mixture and put into 3 qt crockpot. Cook on low for 3-4 hours (watch to see that the peanut butter sauce doesn't start burning).<p>

<p>About 20 minutes before serving, cook 8 ounces of linguine according to package directions. For the last 2 minutes of cooking add the following ingredients: 1 1/2 cups shredded carrot, 1/4 pound snow peas, trimmed and halved crosswise, 1/2 of a red bell pepper cut in strips.
Reserve 1/3-1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add to the crockpot mixture. Drain the pasta and vegetables and place in a large bowl. Pour chicken mixture over pasta. Toss well. (Or if the crockpot is large enough, just pour the pasta into the pot and mix. Serve from the crock).</p>

<h2>Commentary</h2>

<p>We didn't have any bell peppers, so I skipped that part. I substituted regular peas for snow peas, again out of necessity. Finally, I used angel hair pasta instead of linguine. In the end, it was awesome, and I had a hard time stopping.</p>

<p>Hopefully if you choose to cook this one up, you love it as much as I did. Feel free to leave any recipe recommendations in the comments for me. I'm no expert, but I can follow a recipe pretty well most of the time.</p>
