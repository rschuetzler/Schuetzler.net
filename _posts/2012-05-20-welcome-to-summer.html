<p>So, it's that time of year. As a grad student, my summers aren't terribly 
different from my school years. I don't have class, but in its place I have a 
whole host of papers, projects, and milestones to work on. This summer I have
to write up my preliminary exam (aka "prelim") so I can take that next step 
toward graduation. In the Fall I will have the written prelim, wherein I 
present on my paper that is at or around journal quality. I'm looking forward
to getting some data to analyze soon, and then the paper will start to write 
itself (ya right).</p>

<p>Also, Diablo III could not have come out at a worse time. With so much to do
this summer, I pretty much got sucked in completely this week. Tomorrow it's 
back to full-time work as usual. It was certainly fun to take a weekend and 
play a ton. This was mostly enabled by pretty much the whole family getting
sick. We had impetigo, conjunctivitis, a cold, and a migraine in our family.
All that seems to be clearing up now, though. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>Not much else to say here. I keep trying to reboot the blog thing, but then
I get busy with real life and lose interest. It will probably happen again, 
but that's life, I guess.</p>
