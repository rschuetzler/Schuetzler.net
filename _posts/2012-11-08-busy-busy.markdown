Life is busy. That is all.

I am returning my blog here because I finally learned what Markdown means, so
I can use it now with my sweet Jekyll blog. Wish I'd learned about that sooner.

Of interest to possibly nobody but me, I've started to use Vim quite a bit. I'm
not sure how good it is for me, but it sure does feel cool. Someone on reddit
posted a gif that pretty accurately portrays [how I feel when I use
Vim](http://i.imgur.com/Lt9nB.gif). I'm nowhere near that cool, but I like the
analogy.
